## D-001 — npm/pnpm Workspace Monorepo for src/mcp/*

**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Task**: E-1
**Decision**: npm workspaces (confirmed — matches blueprint workspace.md §2)

### Why needed
16 MCP servers in `src/mcp/` each carry their own `node_modules/`. Every server independently installs `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (and in some cases `zod`, `typescript`, `shell-quote`, `@playwright/test`). This creates 16x duplication, version drift risk, and a fragmented upgrade surface. An npm/pnpm workspace at the project root hoists shared deps to a single location and enforces a unified version resolution.

### What changes
- A new `package.json` is added at the repository root with `"workspaces": ["src/mcp/*"]`.
- No new third-party packages are installed — only existing packages are reorganised under workspace hoisting.
- Each MCP server retains its own `package.json` for metadata and runtime entry point; no coupling is introduced at the runtime layer.

### Alternatives considered
1. **Do nothing** — 16 fragmented installs; version drift is a known risk (see `.ai/REVIEWS.md` ARCH_AUDIT 2026-04-14). Rejected.
2. **Symlink approach (manual)** — brittle; does not handle transitive deps. Rejected.
3. **pnpm workspaces** — equivalent to npm workspaces for this use case; requires installing pnpm globally. Lower friction to use npm workspaces since Node.js 16+ ships npm 7+ with native workspace support. Preferred option pending human decision.
4. **npm workspaces (chosen draft)** — zero new tooling required; hoisting is deterministic; lock file is unified at root. Strongly preferred.

### Size / weight
- No net-new dependencies. Reduces total `node_modules` disk footprint by approximately 15x (16 copies → 1 hoisted copy of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`).
- Root `package.json`: ~200 bytes. No runtime impact.

### Security track record
- npm workspaces is a built-in npm feature (no third-party package). No CVE surface added.
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — already present across all servers; version pinning via a single root lock file improves auditability.

### Maintenance status
- npm workspaces: maintained as part of Node.js core toolchain. No separate release cadence.

### License
- npm (ISC) — already in use. No new license introduced.

### Rollback plan
- Delete root `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Each MCP server's own `package.json` remains untouched. Run `npm install` inside each `src/mcp/<server>/` directory to restore isolated installs. No source code changes required.
