# DECISIONS (Append-only — architectural and dependency decisions)

## D-001 — npm/pnpm Workspace Monorepo for src/mcp/*

**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Task**: E-1
**Decision**: npm workspaces (confirmed — matches blueprint workspace.md §2)

### Why needed
16 MCP servers in `src/mcp/` each carry their own `node_modules/`. Every server independently installs `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (and in some cases `zod`, `typescript`, `shell-quote`, `@playwright/test`). This creates 16x duplication, version drift risk, and a fragmented upgrade surface. An npm/pnpm workspace at the project root hoists shared deps to a single location and enforces a unified version resolution.

### What changes
- A new `package.json` is added at the repository root with `"workspaces": ["src/mcp/*"]`.
- No new third-party packages are installed — only existing packages are reorganised under workspace hoisting.
- Each MCP server retains its own `package.json` for metadata and runtime entry point; no coupling is introduced at the runtime layer.

### Alternatives considered
1. **Do nothing** — 16 fragmented installs; version drift is a known risk (see `.ai/REVIEWS.md` ARCH_AUDIT 2026-04-14). Rejected.
2. **Symlink approach (manual)** — brittle; does not handle transitive deps. Rejected.
3. **pnpm workspaces** — equivalent to npm workspaces for this use case; requires installing pnpm globally. Lower friction to use npm workspaces since Node.js 16+ ships npm 7+ with native workspace support. Preferred option pending human decision.
4. **npm workspaces (chosen draft)** — zero new tooling required; hoisting is deterministic; lock file is unified at root. Strongly preferred.

### Size / weight
- No net-new dependencies. Reduces total `node_modules` disk footprint by approximately 15x (16 copies → 1 hoisted copy of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`).
- Root `package.json`: ~200 bytes. No runtime impact.

### Security track record
- npm workspaces is a built-in npm feature (no third-party package). No CVE surface added.
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — already present across all servers; version pinning via a single root lock file improves auditability.

### Maintenance status
- npm workspaces: maintained as part of Node.js core toolchain. No separate release cadence.

### License
- npm (ISC) — already in use. No new license introduced.

### Rollback plan
- Delete root `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Each MCP server's own `package.json` remains untouched. Run `npm install` inside each `src/mcp/<server>/` directory to restore isolated installs. No source code changes required.

## D-002 — computer-use-mcp: New MCP Server for Native Computer Use (E-8)

**Date**: 2026-04-21
**Task**: E-8
**Decision**: computer-use-mcp (confirmed 2026-04-21)

### Why needed
`vibe-check-mcp` uses Playwright (DOM/headless Chrome scraping) for visual QA. This approach misses native UI elements, OS-level dialogs, and non-web surfaces. The blueprint (`.ai/blueprints/capabilities.md` §2) mandates augmenting vibe-check-mcp with native OS-level Computer Use capabilities so TestSprite can visually assert UI state without DOM coupling — aligning with Project Mariner / Claude Computer Use.

### Alternatives considered
1. **Extend Playwright** — DOM scraping; can't interact with native OS windows, Electron chrome, or non-web surfaces. Rejected.
2. **Screenshot diffing (pixelmatch/resemble.js)** — no interaction capability; brittle to font/DPI changes. Rejected.
3. **Selenium + OS-level driver** — heavyweight; no AI-native interaction model. Rejected.
4. **computer-use-mcp (chosen draft)** — wraps the Claude Computer Use API (screen capture + coordinate click + keyboard) in an MCP server; sandboxed to a headless X11/Wayland virtual display. Directly integrates with the Triad AI loop. Strongly preferred per blueprint.

### Size / weight
- New MCP server at `src/mcp/computer-use-mcp/` (~300–500 LOC Node.js).
- Runtime deps: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (already hoisted in workspace), `xvfb` (virtual display, system-level, no npm package), optionally `screenshot-desktop` (~15KB npm).
- No net-new npm packages beyond what is already in the workspace.

### Security track record
- Anthropic SDK: actively maintained, no known critical CVEs as of 2026-04.
- X11/Xvfb virtual display: isolation boundary between agent and host display. Well-understood Linux subsystem.
- **Key risk**: if sandbox escapes, agent can interact with host machine. Mitigation: strict `DISPLAY` env var isolation + sandboxed headless buffer only — no access to `$DISPLAY=:0` (host display). Reviewed by `security_engineer` gate (mandatory for Tier 3).

### Maintenance status
- Anthropic SDK: actively maintained by Anthropic. Monthly releases.
- Xvfb: part of X.Org project; stable, minimal churn.

### License
- Anthropic SDK: MIT — compatible.
- Xvfb: MIT/X11 — compatible.

### Rollback plan
- Delete `src/mcp/computer-use-mcp/` directory and remove its entry from `src/config/registry.json` and `.mcp.json`. Re-run `bash install-ai-os.sh` to sync. vibe-check-mcp (Playwright) remains intact and resumes as the sole visual QA tool.

## D-003 — approval-mcp: No New Dependencies (E-10)

**Date**: 2026-04-24
**Task**: E-10
**Decision**: No new npm packages — Node.js built-ins only (confirmed 2026-04-24)

### Why needed
`approval-mcp` implements the HITL gate for Tier 3 operations. It needs: (1) an interactive terminal prompt for Y/N approval, (2) persistent approval/rejection audit log in SQLite.

### Alternatives considered
1. **`inquirer` / `prompts` npm packages** — interactive CLI prompts; adds ~500KB. Rejected — `readline` (built-in) covers the Y/N use case with zero footprint.
2. **`better-sqlite3`** — npm package for SQLite. Rejected — `node:sqlite` (Node.js 22+ built-in, already used by token-budget-mcp) covers the use case with zero new install surface.
3. **`node:readline` + `node:sqlite` (chosen)** — both are Node.js built-ins; zero new npm dependencies; no install, no CVE surface, no license risk.

### Size / weight
- Zero net-new npm packages. No increase in `node_modules` footprint.

### Security track record
- `node:readline`: Node.js core, no CVE surface.
- `node:sqlite`: Node.js 22+ built-in; same audit surface as the Node.js runtime itself.

### Maintenance status
- Both modules maintained as part of the Node.js core team release cadence.

### License
- Node.js built-ins: MIT — compatible.

### Rollback plan
- Delete `src/mcp/approval-mcp/` and remove from `registry.json` / `.mcp.json`. No npm uninstall required.
