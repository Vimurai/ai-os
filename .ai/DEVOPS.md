## DEVOPS-001 — Bootloader Fallback CI Validation (E-2)

**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Task**: E-2
**Status**: PENDING IMPLEMENTATION

### What is changing and why
A new test suite `tests/suites/resilience_test.sh` will be created to validate the Bootloader's three-layer degradation mechanism (per `.ai/blueprints/bootloader.md` §3):

1. **Simulated Node Failure test** — Temporarily renames/chmods `src/mcp/orchestrator-mcp/index.js` to simulate a crash, then asserts the system falls back to the `ai-exec` CLI layer reading `.ai/state.json`.
2. **Fallback Verification test** — Asserts JIT read requests successfully return data via the secondary fallback path (Python/Bash parsing of `state.json`).
3. **State Integrity test** — After simulated crash + recovery, runs `PRAGMA integrity_check;` against `.ai/state.sqlite` and diffs against `state.json` to assert zero corruption.

No existing CI workflow files are being created or modified at this time. The test suite is a standalone shell script; wiring into a GitHub Actions workflow is a separate future task.

### Security implications
- **No new secrets required.** Tests operate on local filesystem only; no network access.
- **No new permissions.** The `chmod` in the simulated-failure test is scoped to a non-sensitive test fixture and must be reverted by the test teardown.
- **SQLite access is read-only** in the fallback path per the blueprint constraint (§2): fallback scripts MUST only execute read-only queries unless using `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION` with `PRAGMA synchronous = FULL`.
- **No CI secrets exposure.** Test output must be scrubbed of any file paths that could leak internal directory structure before being logged to CI artifacts.

### Pipeline order enforced
The resilience test suite will be positioned after `lint` and `typecheck` but before `build`:
1. `lint`
2. `typecheck` (if applicable)
3. `test` (unit + **resilience**)
4. `build`
5. `deploy` (protected branches only)

### Rollback plan
- Delete `tests/suites/resilience_test.sh`. No other files are modified by E-2.
- If the test is later wired into CI, remove the workflow step referencing it. The test is additive-only and has no side effects on production code.

### Branch strategy
- Implement and validate on the current branch (`master`) before merging. Run `bash tests/suites/resilience_test.sh` locally to confirm PASS before any commit.
