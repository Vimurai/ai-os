# Blueprint: Interactive Bridge (Tmux Watcher)

## Goal & Architecture
**Goal**: Enable a "Ping-Pong" autonomous loop where the Architect (Agy) and Engineer (Claude) can operate side-by-side in a terminal, automatically waking each other up and passing control without a heavy, brittle API wrapper.
**Architecture**: A lightweight, global Bash watcher (`ai watch`) that uses `tmux send-keys` to orchestrate interactive CLI binaries, triggered by an explicit MCP signaling tool. It features a queueing mechanism to handle busy agents and guarantees automatic handoff.

## Core Concept
Because interactive REPLs block on standard input, they cannot natively listen to a database. The Interactive Bridge solves this by using a background watcher script. When an agent finishes its phase, it calls a new MCP tool (`handoff_control`) which appends to a persistent signal queue. The background watcher detects queued signals, verifies that the target pane is in an idle/ready state (not actively executing a long-running tool), and injects the appropriate keystrokes. Startup drain and stateful persistence (via a `delivered` flag) ensure that signals are never dropped if a process restarts. Automated workflows ensure this signal is always emitted at the end of sessions.

## Components
1. **`handoff_control` (MCP Tool)**
   - Responsibility: An explicit tool in `task-synchronizer-mcp` that allows agents to emit a structured signal (e.g., `{ target: "claude", message: "Planning complete." }`) to `.ai/signal.json`. Appends to a queue.
2. **`ai watch` (Global CLI Command)**
   - Responsibility: A global Bash script installed to `~/.ai-os/bin/ai-watch`. When run inside a project directory, it resolves the current `tmux` session, tails `.ai/signal.json`, and executes `tmux send-keys` to route the message to the target pane.
   - **Busy Detection & Per-Target Independence**: Monitors the target pane's TTY state. Independent target processing ensures that a busy Claude does not block a signal meant for an idle Gemini.
   - **Single-Writer Lock**: Uses a cross-process lock to safely mutate signal statuses.
3. **Automated Handoff Enforcement**
   - Responsibility: Agents (via prompts or framework scripts) are strictly mandated to invoke `handoff_control` automatically when their task queue is exhausted or planning is complete.
   - **Cross-Role Auto-Handoff (E-204)**: When a role creates a task for a different role via the shell primitive `ai add-task` (e.g., Architect creates a task for the Engineer), the tool automatically triggers `ai handoff` to wake the target role. This eliminates manual signaling when delegating work. Can be bypassed via `AI_OS_NO_AUTO_HANDOFF=1`.

## Data Model
**`.ai/signal.json` Payload (Queue Array):**
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2026-06-02T12:00:00Z",
    "target": "claude", 
    "message": "Gemini finished planning. Execute OPEN tasks.",
    "delivered": true,
    "delivered_reason": "pane_ready",
    "delivered_ts": "2026-06-02T12:00:02Z"
  }
]
```
*Note: Do not mutate or overwrite the initial queue behavior implemented in E-118; layer the `delivered` flags on top.*

## API / Interface Contracts
- **`mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__handoff_control(target, message)`**:
  - Appends the new payload to the array in `.ai/signal.json` with `delivered: false`.
  - Returns confirmation to the sending agent.
- **`ai start` (D-059, cli-collapse.md §`ai start`)**: one-command Triad launch — creates/reuses the tmux
  session, lays out panes from `.ai/roles.json` (lower `pane_identifier` → lower `pane_index`), launches
  each role via `ai pane <role>`, and runs `ai watch` in its own pane. Idempotent; composes only those two
  primitives.
- **`ai watch` execution**:
  - Scopes itself to `$(pwd -P)` and, inside tmux, to its own session (D-068, E-253).
  - Maps `target` to panes (supporting fuzzy matches and conventional indices). For semantic
    targets (`architect`/`engineer`) the precedence is fixed by §Pane Resolution Precedence (D-054).
  - Dequeues and injects ONLY when the target pane's current command is idle.
  - Features Startup Backlog Drain: upon restart, processes any signals where `delivered: false`.
  - Marks signals as `delivered: true` with a timestamp and reason after successful injection using per-target FIFOs.

## Pane Resolution Precedence (D-054 Amendment, 2026-09-04)
The E-117 order (exact title → fuzzy title → window name → ordinal) let a Claude-authored
conversation-summary title containing the word "architect" swallow an Architect handoff into the
Engineer pane (reproduced live twice, COMM.md 2026-09-04 — gap G3). Explicit configuration beats
heuristics. For a **semantic target** whose role is mapped in `.ai/roles.json`, `resolve_pane`
MUST resolve in this order:
1. **Exact pane-title match** on the role name (`ai pane <role>` pins this title; deterministic opt-in).
2. **roles.json ordinal** among agent panes (`pane_identifier`, E-122 shell-exclusion rules unchanged).
3. **Fuzzy title** substring, then **window-name** substring — last resort only, reached solely when
   no agent pane exists at the ordinal (e.g. the mapped pane is not running yet).
The E-122 TIER-B degrade (no command column) is unchanged and applies within step 2.
Legacy provider targets (`claude`/`gemini`) keep the E-117 order but are deprecated (see
`role-abstraction.md §Same-Provider Triad`): warn on stderr; fail closed when `.ai/roles.json`
maps both roles to that provider.

## Security
- **Isolation**: `ai watch` must strictly filter `tmux list-panes` by the current working directory to prevent injecting commands into other concurrent projects.
  - **D-068 (2026-09-11, E-253)**: the candidate set is ALSO restricted to the watcher's own tmux session (`list-panes -s -t <session_name>`) when the watcher runs inside tmux; `AI_WATCH_ALL_SESSIONS=1` restores the `-a` scan. The path filter compares against the project's PHYSICAL path (`pwd -P`): tmux reports the process's resolved cwd, so a project entered through a symlink matched zero panes and silently dropped every signal. The launcher side (one tmux session per project, stamped `AI_OS_PROJECT`) is specified in `cli-collapse.md §Per-Project tmux Sessions`.
- **Command Injection**: The `message` field must be safely escaped before being passed to `tmux send-keys` to prevent arbitrary shell execution if an agent hallucinates shell characters.

## Execution Constraints
- Requires `tmux` to be installed and active.
- **Cross-process write-lock**: Implement a bounded spin-lock when reading/mutating `.ai/signal.json` to prevent race conditions.
- **Delivered-aware eviction**: The queue should periodically prune or bound the number of `delivered: true` messages kept, to prevent infinite growth.
- **Bounded Hold**: Signals held due to a busy pane should not block other targets from receiving their signals.

## Rollback Plan
- Kill the `ai watch` process. Agents revert to requiring manual human keystrokes to begin their turn.
- Revert `.ai/signal.json` to a flat object if queue parsing fails.

## E-## Task Breakdown
- **E-114**: Add the `handoff_control` tool to `task-synchronizer-mcp` to manage `.ai/signal.json` writes.
- **E-115**: Create the `ai-watch` global bash script in `src/bin/ai-watch` and update the installer to deploy it.
- **E-117**: Harden ai-watch pane resolution: implement fuzzy matching for titles, check window names, and handle base-index 1 environments.
- **E-118**: Refactor `handoff_control` and `ai-watch` to support a signal queue (array) and busy-state detection before injection.
- **E-119**: Enforce automatic handoff in Claude and Gemini workflows by updating prompt instructions (e.g., `ai-handoff` and `ai-task` skills) to mandate calling `handoff_control`.
- **E-124**: Implement the smart ai-watch delivery model: stateful persistence using a `delivered` flag, startup backlog drain, single-writer lock, and per-target independent FIFOs.
- **E-204**: Auto-trigger `ai handoff` on cross-role task creation. `ai add-task` automatically signals the target role (prefix E -> engineer, P -> architect) unless `AI_OS_NO_AUTO_HANDOFF=1` is set.
- **E-209**: Re-order `resolve_pane` for semantic targets per §Pane Resolution Precedence (D-054): exact title → roles.json ordinal → fuzzy title → window name.
- **E-211**: Deprecate legacy `claude`/`gemini` targets — stderr warning; fail closed when both roles map to the same provider.

## Binding by Pane Option, Held Entries Made Visible (D-073 Amendment, 2026-09-17)
Live evidence 2026-09-17: two Engineer handoffs (2026-09-16 15:01Z and 17:59Z) sat undelivered
for a day while a healthy watcher ran; the four multi-hour outliers in `signal.json` (3 h to
50 h) were each delivered by a DIFFERENT watcher pid than their neighbours — they waited for a
restart, not for a slow tick (median lag is 1 s). Root cause: `ai pane <role>` pins the role
title with `tmux select-pane -T <role>` and names NO target pane, so the title lands on the
ACTIVE pane — which, after `ai start`'s untargeted `split-window`, is the watcher's own bash
pane. Pass 1 (exact title) does not check that the match is an agent pane, resolves to the
bash pane, the ready check says "busy", and `MAX_HOLD=0` holds the entry forever without a
line of output. The same mis-titling exists on this machine in four other projects, and
`ai_watch_test.sh:546` asserts the failure as correct behaviour. A second defect compounds it:
Claude Code overwrites pane titles with its conversation summary, so the pinned title never
survives on the agent panes anyway and routing silently falls back to the ordinal pass, which
miscounts once subagent panes appear in the session.

Rules from D-073:
1. **The binding is a tmux pane OPTION, not a title.** `ai pane <role>` sets
   `tmux set-option -p -t "$TMUX_PANE" @ai_os_role <role>` (and `ai start`'s re-pin does the
   same, targeted). The title is still set for humans, always with `-t "$TMUX_PANE"`, and is
   never read for routing. Pass 1 of `resolve_pane` becomes: the pane in scope whose
   `@ai_os_role` equals the target AND whose current command is an agent (`_is_agent_cmd`).
   A non-agent pane can never be a Pass 1 match. Pass 2 (roles.json ordinal among agent
   panes) is unchanged. Title and window-name substrings are the last resort only, and only
   among agent panes. `ai start --status` derives its role column from the option.
2. **A held entry is never silent.** When the watcher holds an entry it writes
   `hold_reason` (`no-pane` | `busy` | `foreign-session`), `hold_since` and `attempts` onto
   the entry (once per reason change, under the lock) and prints one stderr line per change.
   `ai start --status` and `ai doctor` show `queued: N (oldest held 2h 13m, reason no-pane)`.
   `MAX_HOLD=0` remains the default — nothing expires silently; it is reported instead.
3. **Configuration is re-read.** `roles.json` is re-read when its mtime changes, every tick,
   not only at startup.
4. **Both writers are atomic and never write unlocked.** `signal-handoff.mjs` writes
   tmp + rename like the watcher does; on lock timeout a writer retries with backoff and
   fails with `[SIGNAL_LOCKED]` after 5 s instead of appending without the lock. A lock
   directory older than 10 s whose owner pid is dead is reclaimed.
5. **Test watchers die with their suite.** Every suite that starts `ai watch` registers it
   with `register_cleanup` (E-240); the harness's leak diff counts `ai-watch` processes.
   Seventeen orphans (ppid 1, cwd under the temp dir, some 16 h old) were running on
   2026-09-17. `ai clean` (D-074) removes such orphans on demand.
6. **Ready check — deferred.** `#{pane_current_command}` cannot distinguish a thinking Claude
   from an idle one; Claude Code's input queue absorbs a mid-turn message today. No change is
   funded until a failure is observed and reproduced; `SUBMIT_DELAY` stays 0.1 s.

- **E-269**: Bind roles by `@ai_os_role` pane option (targeted `-t "$TMUX_PANE"`), agent-only Pass 1, status column from the option, fix `ai_watch_test.sh:546`.
- **E-271**: Held-entry visibility (`hold_reason`/`hold_since`/`attempts`, stderr line, status + doctor line), `roles.json` mtime re-read, atomic locked writers with `[SIGNAL_LOCKED]`, test watchers under `register_cleanup` and counted by the leak diff.
