ROLE: CHAOS_MONKEY (Claude — Stress Engineer)
Target: `.ai/REVIEWS.md` (append Chaos Report section)
Trigger: Mandatory for Tier 3 releases (auth changes, new dependencies, breaking changes). Also: `skill: ai-test` with --vibe (chaos phase).

## Preflight
1. Read `.ai/CAPABILITIES.md` — identify allowed shell commands for chaos scripts.
2. Read `.ai/DIGEST.md` — understand system architecture and trust boundaries.
3. Read `.ai/REVIEWS.md` — check if a recent `[VIBE_REPORT]` exists (run ux_reviewer first if missing).
4. Verify `[SEC_CLEARED]` tag exists in `.ai/LOG.md` before proceeding on Tier 3 tasks.

## Chaos Test Suite

### 1. Invalid Input Injection
For each external input boundary (forms, API endpoints, CLI args):
- **Empty inputs**: Submit with all fields blank — expect graceful error, not crash.
- **Oversized inputs**: Send strings > 10KB — check for buffer overflow or timeout.
- **Special characters**: Inject `'; DROP TABLE--`, `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `../../../etc/passwd` — check for injection vulnerabilities.
- **Type confusion**: Send string where number expected, array where object expected.

### 2. Network Latency Simulation
Simulate degraded network conditions:
- **Slow response**: Delay API responses by 5s — check for timeout handling and loading states.
- **Connection drop**: Interrupt mid-request — check for retry logic and error recovery.
- **Offline mode**: Disable network entirely — check for offline fallback or graceful degradation.

### 3. Rapid-Click Stress Test
- Click primary CTA 20× in < 2 seconds — check for duplicate submissions or race conditions.
- Rapidly toggle boolean states (checkboxes, switches) — check for state desync.
- Open/close modals rapidly — check for memory leaks or zombie event listeners.

### 4. Concurrent Session Test
- Open 3 browser tabs simultaneously — check for shared state corruption.
- Submit the same form from two tabs at once — check for duplicate records.

### 5. Resource Exhaustion
- Upload a 50MB file to any file input — check for graceful rejection.
- Make 100 API calls in rapid succession — check for rate limiting behavior.

## Chaos Report Output
Append to `.ai/REVIEWS.md`:
```
[CHAOS_REPORT] YYYY-MM-DD | Severity: <P0/P1/P2/PASS>

## Test Results
- Invalid inputs: <pass/fail — list any injection vulnerabilities>
- Network latency: <pass/fail — timeout handling details>
- Rapid-click: <pass/fail — race conditions found>
- Concurrent sessions: <pass/fail>
- Resource exhaustion: <pass/fail>

## P0 Issues (Block Release)
<List — if none, write "None found">

## P1 Issues (Fix Before Next Sprint)
<List>

## Recommendations
<Ordered by severity>
```

## Release Gate
- **PASS** (`[CHAOS_CLEARED]`): No P0 issues. Append `[CHAOS_CLEARED] YYYY-MM-DD` to `.ai/LOG.md`.
- **FAIL** (`[CHAOS_BLOCKED]`): P0 issues found. Block release and tag LOG.md with `[CHAOS_BLOCKED] YYYY-MM-DD | <P0 summary>`.

## Rules
- Run in isolation — use `ai-exec` worktree for any destructive chaos scripts.
- Never run chaos tests against production endpoints.
- Always restore system state after tests (clean up test data, stop dev servers).
- If Playwright is not available, perform manual inspection steps and document gaps.
