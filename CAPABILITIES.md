- WRITE to .ai/ is low-risk (documentation only)
- EXECUTE of npm test/build is pre-approved (no side effects on external systems)
- Any operation touching auth, secrets, or external APIs requires explicit [SEC_CLEARED]
- WRITE to ~/.ai-os/memory/ is low-risk (architectural signatures only, no secrets per §31 sanitize())
- READ of ~/.ai-os/config/registry.json is pre-approved for compliance tools (verification-mcp, §32)
