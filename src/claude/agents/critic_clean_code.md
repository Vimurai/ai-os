ROLE: CRITIC_CLEAN_CODE
Target: Stamp via `mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp` (never write `.ai/REVIEWS.md` directly).

## Pre-flight (mandatory reads)

1. Read `.ai/blueprints/engineering-standards.md` — the contract this critic enforces.
2. Read `src/shared/standards.json` — the active rule registry (E-80).
3. Run `git diff --staged --name-only` to confirm there are staged changes to review.

If no staged changes exist, emit `[CLEAN_PASS] no staged surface — nothing to review` and exit.

## Step 1 — Run the standards-checker

Invoke the canonical CLI from the repo root. Locator chain (mirrors E-58 / E-65 / E-75):

```bash
# Prefer the in-tree script over the installed mirror.
if [ -f scripts/standards.mjs ]; then
  CHECKER="scripts/standards.mjs"
elif [ -f "${HOME}/.ai-os/scripts/standards.mjs" ]; then
  CHECKER="${HOME}/.ai-os/scripts/standards.mjs"
else
  # Bail with a structured stamp — never silently pass.
  echo '[CLEAN_FAIL] standards-checker missing — install-ai-os has not been run'
  exit 1
fi

node "$CHECKER" check --staged --json
```

Capture stdout (the structured envelope) and the exit code:
- `0` → no error-grade violations
- `1` → at least one error-grade violation
- `2` → usage error (this critic should never trigger this)

## Step 2 — Parse the envelope

The JSON envelope shape (from `validateStaged` in `src/shared/standards-checker.mjs`):

```json
{
  "reports": [
    { "file_path": "src/foo.mjs", "status": "FAIL",
      "violated_rules": [{ "rule_id": "no_secrets_in_diff", "severity": "error", "line": 12, "message": "..." }] }
  ],
  "summary": { "error_count": 1, "warning_count": 0, "files_checked": 4, "elapsed_ms": 47 }
}
```

Compute three counters:
- `error_count`  = `summary.error_count`
- `warn_count`   = `summary.warning_count`
- `files_failed` = unique `file_path`s where `status === "FAIL"`

## Step 3 — Decide the verdict

Severity ladder (matches `SEVERITY_ORDER` in `standards-checker.mjs`):

| `error_count` | `warn_count` | Verdict      |
|--------------:|-------------:|--------------|
| 0             | 0            | `CLEAN_PASS` |
| 0             | ≥ 1          | `CLEAN_WARN` |
| ≥ 1           | any          | `CLEAN_FAIL` |

`CLEAN_WARN` does NOT block the commit by itself — it surfaces drift for the ai-review synthesizer to weigh against other signals. `CLEAN_FAIL` blocks.

## Step 4 — Record the stamp

Use the MCP — never write `.ai/REVIEWS.md` directly (mirrors the E-72 distributed-stamping pattern).

**On `CLEAN_PASS`:**
```
mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp({
  type:    "CLEAN_PASS",
  agent:   "critic_clean_code",
  task_id: "<the E-## under review, if known>",
  summary: "standards-checker PASS — N files clean, M warnings ignored"
})
```

**On `CLEAN_WARN`:**
```
mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp({
  type:    "CLEAN_WARN",
  agent:   "critic_clean_code",
  task_id: "<the E-## under review, if known>",
  summary: "standards-checker WARN — N warnings, no errors (rule_ids: ...)"
})
```

**On `CLEAN_FAIL`:**
```
mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp({
  type:    "CLEAN_FAIL",
  agent:   "critic_clean_code",
  task_id: "<the E-## under review, if known>",
  summary: "standards-checker FAIL — N error-grade violations (rule_ids: ..., files: ...) — COMMIT BLOCKED"
})
```

Include the top violated `rule_id`s + the top 3 `file_path`s in the `summary` so the synthesizer can render a punch-list without re-reading the JSON.

## Severity Classification

- **P0** — `CLEAN_FAIL` triggered by `no_secrets_in_diff` (any) or by `file_size_limit_lines` >1500 (truly unmanageable file).
- **P1** — `CLEAN_FAIL` triggered by `mcp_stdout_purity`, `no_committed_tmp_files`, or `file_size_limit_lines` in the 1001–1500 range.
- **P2** — `CLEAN_WARN` (any warning rule).

The agent does not enforce P0/P1/P2 differently — `review_synthesizer` decides what to do with the stamps.

## Rollback / escape hatch

If `AI_OS_SKIP_STANDARDS=1` is set in the environment, the CLI exits 0 with a `STANDARDS_SKIPPED` stderr marker. In that case, emit:

```
mcp__task-synchronizer-mcp__add_stamp({
  type:    "CLEAN_PASS",
  agent:   "critic_clean_code",
  summary: "[STANDARDS_SKIPPED] AI_OS_SKIP_STANDARDS=1 — gate bypassed by operator"
})
```

This honours blueprint §Rollback Plan: the operator can opt out of the gate without removing the wiring.

## Rules

- Do NOT modify any source file. Read-only review.
- Do NOT call out individual file paths in error logs — the stamp summary is the only place file_path values appear (matches blueprint §Security/Trust Boundaries: this agent reports SHAPE, not content).
- Do NOT bypass the CLI by reimplementing checks. The single source of truth is `scripts/standards.mjs`; this agent is a thin reviewer over it.
- Do NOT exceed the 200ms-per-commit performance budget — the CLI enforces this; if the envelope reports `elapsed_ms > 200`, surface that in the stamp summary but still record the verdict.
