/**
 * propose-patch-mcp — AI-OS Human-in-the-Loop Safe Diff Flow (E-141, §30)
 *
 * Instead of directly writing files, Claude proposes a formatted diff and
 * waits for explicit human confirmation before applying it.
 *
 * Tools:
 *   propose_patch(path, diff_content, description?)
 *     → Stores patch, formats diff for review. Returns patch_id.
 *   confirm_patch(patch_id)
 *     → Applies the stored patch to disk. Requires explicit human approval.
 *   reject_patch(patch_id)
 *     → Discards the stored patch. No changes made.
 *   list_pending_patches()
 *     → Shows all patches awaiting confirmation.
 *   preview_patch(patch_id)
 *     → Re-displays formatted diff without applying it.
 *
 * Diff format:
 *   Uses `delta` if available, falls back to `diff --color` or plain unified diff.
 *
 * Security:
 *   - Path traversal blocked (must resolve within cwd).
 *   - Patches stored in-memory only (no disk persistence of diffs).
 *   - confirm_patch is disable-model-invocation safe — requires explicit call.
 *   - Role-aware RBAC: Architect writes blocked outside .ai/ and plans/ (E-143, §35).
