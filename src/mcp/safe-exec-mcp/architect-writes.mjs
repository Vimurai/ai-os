// EXTRACTED FROM index.js (E-216): the analyser had grown past the 1000-line standards
// limit, and this is the cohesive piece — one question ("does this command write
// outside .ai//plans/?"), asked of three different surfaces (a tool-supplied path, a
// shell command, and the paths a verb names). Splitting it here keeps that question in
// one file rather than interleaved with the general command analysis.
//
// The invariant this module exists to uphold, learned across seven audit rounds:
// TEXT THE PARSER HAS ALREADY CLASSIFIED AS DATA MUST NEVER BE READ AS SYNTAX.
// Every defect found in it was that rule broken — a quoted `>` in prose, `-t` taken
// from another command's flags, `|` inside a printf format, `>` inside an awk literal,
// a newline inside a quoted string, a heredoc tag narrower than the shell's. Anything
// added here should be checked against that invariant first.

// command. The Write/Edit tools hand the hook an ABSOLUTE path instead, so it must
// first be normalised against the project root before the same .ai/ | plans/ rule
// can be applied. Kept separate from the token-based command analyser because the
// input shape differs: one path, already parsed, no shell quoting to reason about.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: under a same-provider Triad the Architect pane is Claude, which
// unlike agy HAS Write/Edit tools. §35 ANTI-DRIFT was prompt-level only for those.
//
// SCOPE — READ THIS BEFORE RELYING ON IT (E-208 audit; widened by E-216 / D-055 R1):
// this function covers the NATIVE write tools (Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit).
// The other two channels are covered ELSEWHERE, not here:
//   - shell writes  → analyzeArchitectWrites() below (redirections, tee/cp/mv/install/
//     ln/rsync/dd/truncate/patch, sed -i / perl -i, git apply; inline interpreters
//     blocked outright)
//   - MCP write tools → `permissions.deny` in .claude/settings.architect.json (E-216),
//     because a hook cannot reliably see a pre-approved MCP call's arguments
// STATED RESIDUAL, still not covered: exotic encodings (base64-piped payloads), git
// plumbing (hash-object/update-index/update-ref), and interactive editors (vim/ed).
// So the shell channel is substantially narrowed but not airtight — this is strong
// defence in depth, and a determined Architect with a shell is still not fully
// contained. The Git Lane (E-214) is the last checkpoint before history.
//
// PATH GATING ITSELF also has limits, so do not read the list above as "everything
// else is airtight":
//   - HARDLINKS are handled below by an nlink check, NOT by path resolution — no
//     resolution algorithm can see through one (see the check in this function).
//   - TOCTOU: the hook approves a path, then the tool opens it. A concurrent
//     `ln -sf` between those two moments is not observable here. Inherent to
//     hook-based gating, and it needs the same shell channel already declared open.

// ── E-216 (D-055 R1): Architect shell write policy ───────────────────────────
// The E-208 gate covers the NATIVE write tools; this closes the shell channel that
// audit left open (`echo pwned > src/bin/ai` wrote real bytes to a real source file).
//
// REDIRECTS ARE READ STRUCTURALLY, from shell-quote's parse output, never from the raw
// string. The first cut used a raw regex and was wrong in both directions: it missed
// `echo x>src/x` (no space), `&>` and `>|`, and it fired on a `>` inside QUOTED prose —
// blocking `echo "a -> b"`, `git commit -m "... -> ..."` and `grep '>' notes.md`. The
// Architect's whole job is writing prose into .ai/, and this repo's own notation is
// full of `->`, so that over-block was the more damaging half. parse() yields
// {op:">"} only for a real redirection and never inside quotes.
//
// TARGETS ARE RESOLVED THROUGH THE SAME PATH LOGIC AS THE WRITE-TOOL GATE
// (architectPathVerdict), so the two layers of one rule cannot disagree. A bare prefix
// test let `.ai/../src/x` walk straight out while the Write/Edit layer caught it.
//
// TWO CLASSES:
//   1. Target-bearing forms — allowed only when every resolved target is in scope.
//   2. Inline interpreters — refused when they carry a program (inline flag, heredoc,
//      here-string, or as the sink of a pipe): the write target lives inside a program
//      string this analyser does not execute, so "is the target in scope?" is a
//      question it cannot honestly answer. awk is handled on its own terms — refused
//      only when its program text can write — because `awk '{print $1}' f` is an
//      ordinary read and refusing every awk would over-block badly.
//
// RESOLUTION NOTE: a relative write target is resolved against the PROJECT ROOT, not
// the command's effective cwd, so `cd .ai && echo x > notes.md` and a `$PWD`-built path
// both BLOCK. Both fail closed, and the Architect's own tooling uses repo-relative
// paths, so this is a deliberate conservatism rather than a defect.
//
// STATED RESIDUAL (tests pin this wording): exotic encodings (base64-piped payloads),
// git plumbing (hash-object/update-index/update-ref), interactive editors (vim/ed),
// MCP tool proxying beyond the names denied in the architect overlay, DELETION via
// `find -delete` / `find -exec rm` (this gate reasons about WRITES, not removals), and
// an awk program supplied by `-f` whose file lies outside .ai//plans/ (refused, but the
