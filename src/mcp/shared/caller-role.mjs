// caller-role.mjs — derive the calling Triad role SERVER-SIDE, and enforce the
// Architect's write scope from it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (E-219, D-056 R1, THREAT_MODEL T-PATCHMCP-001):
//   patch-mcp and propose-patch-mcp each carried their own `roleGuard(callerRole, …)`
//   that returned "allow" whenever the CALLER simply omitted `caller_role`. The guard
//   was self-declared: a client that never mentions its role was treated as unrestricted
//   and could write anywhere. That was the only barrier left in any session started
//   without the `.claude/settings.<role>.json` overlay — and an overlay is settings-file
//   config, so it is precisely the layer most likely to be absent (a fresh clone before
//   `ai sync`, a different host, a session launched without `ai pane`).
//
//   The E-216 deny list closes the named route (`mcp__patch-mcp__patch_file`), but a
//   deny list matches TOOL NAMES; it cannot help when the overlay is not loaded at all.
//   So the server must decide for itself.
//
// RESOLUTION ORDER (D-056 R1):
//   1. The HMAC-verified session record, via `safe-exec --verify-role` on the session id
//      the harness exports. Authoritative — the same record the Bash, Write and Git-Lane
//      gates use, so all four agree by construction.
//   2. The server's spawn-frozen `AI_OS_CALLER_ROLE`. An MCP server's environment is
//      fixed when the pane launches it (`ai pane <role>`), so this is launch-time
//      evidence, not something a request can influence.
//   3. NO EVIDENCE → `architect`. This is the fail-closed default and it is deliberately
//      the RESTRICTED role: with nothing to prove otherwise, confine writes to .ai/ and
//      plans/ rather than allow everything. An Engineer session always has evidence,
//      because its overlay and launch env both set the role.
//
// A SELF-REPORTED `caller_role` MAY ONLY ADD RESTRICTION, NEVER LIFT IT. Claiming
// `architect` when the record says `engineer` is honoured (more restrictive); claiming
// `engineer` when the record says `architect` is ignored. That keeps the argument useful
// for a caller that wants to sandbox itself, without making it a bypass.
//
// Rollback: AI_OS_SOVEREIGNTY_LOCK=0 restores the legacy volunteered-role guard.
