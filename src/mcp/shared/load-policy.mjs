/**
 * load-policy.mjs — hot-reload the POLICY modules inside a long-running MCP server
 * (E-237, D-061 §5).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. An MCP server is spawned once and lives for the whole session, and ESM
 * caches a module by URL forever. So a policy edited on disk — or, more often, a mirror
 * refreshed by `ai sync` — never reaches the running server. Throughout the 2026-09-09
 * sprint `run_review` reported a P0 PATH_TRAVERSAL on
 * `source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/../lib/assert.sh"` while the on-disk `traversal-policy.mjs`,
 * byte-identical in `src` and the `~/.ai-os` mirror, graded that exact line P1 with
 * anchor=self_dir. Every review had to be adjudicated by hand against the real module.
 *
 * A gate that cries wolf is worse than one that is merely wrong: people learn to wave it
 * through, and the next finding — a real one — gets waved through with it.
 *
 * HOW. Re-import with a cache-busting query, but ONLY when the file's mtime has actually
 * changed. Busting on every call would re-parse the module on every request and leak a new
 * ESM record each time, since nothing can be evicted from the module registry.
 *
 * `mtimeMs` is sub-millisecond, deliberately. E-229 shipped a whole-second stamp that made
 * the ai-watch re-exec inert for a rewrite landing in the same second the process started —
 * which is precisely the `ai sync` case. Do not coarsen this.
 *
 * Rollback: AI_OS_POLICY_HOT_RELOAD=0 pins the first load for the process lifetime, which
 * is exactly the pre-E-237 behaviour.
