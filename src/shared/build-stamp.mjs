// build-stamp.mjs — Booted-Build Staleness (E-249, D-067 §3).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANNOUNCES. ESM caches a module for the lifetime of the process. An MCP
// server is a LONG-LIVED process: it imports its projector, its policy modules and
// src/mcp/shared/* once, at startup, and serves that code until something restarts it.
// `bash install-ai-os.sh` rewrites ~/.ai-os; `git pull` rewrites src/. Neither reaches a
// running server. The task synchroniser went on serving the PRE-E-245 projector and
// stripped the archive pointer on every write, and E-227's run_review reported a P0 the
// shipped checker no longer emits. In both cases the gate was reporting on code that was
// no longer on disk, and nothing said so.
//
// WHY ANNOUNCE RATHER THAN RELOAD (the D-067 §3 refusal). E-237 hot-reloads four POLICY
// modules — pure, side-effect-free predicates where a mid-process swap is safe. state-db
// and the projectors are NOT in that set and must not join it: the write path's
// correctness cannot depend on which version of a module happened to be resident when a
// transaction started. A stale server is ANNOUNCED with evidence and restarted by the
// operator; it is never patched live. Nor does a server exit on source change — the
// harness does not restart MCP servers, so a self-terminating one is unrecoverable while
// a stale one is merely wrong-and-labelled.
//
// WHAT A STAMP IS. The CONTENT hash of the entry file plus every file in the server's
// `mcp/shared/` directory, and the newest mtime among them. Content, not mtime alone:
// `install-ai-os.sh` rewrites files whether or not their bytes changed (E-229's
// _atomic_copy_tree), and a server serving byte-identical code is not stale — reporting
// it would train the operator to ignore the notice. The mtime is carried anyway because
// it is what the message quotes ("mirror changed <ts>"), and it is read in FLOAT
// milliseconds: whole-second mtime made E-229's watcher re-exec mechanism inert for
// same-second rewrites, which is the exact `ai sync` case.
//
// HOW A SEPARATE PROCESS FINDS OUT. Each server writes ~/.ai-os/run/build-<server>.json at
// startup. `verify_markdown_sync`, `run_preflight`, `ai doctor`, `ai sync` and
// `install-ai-os.sh` read that directory, drop records whose pid is gone, recompute the
// stamp from the SAME paths the record names, and report every mismatch. Comparing
// booted-against-current-at-the-same-path is what makes the check correct for a server
// booted from the mirror AND for one booted from a repo checkout.
//
// Rollback: AI_OS_BUILD_STAMP=0 — no record is written, no `_meta.booted_build` is
// attached, and every consumer reports nothing.

// ── The task-completion gate (D-067 §3, third bullet) ────────────────────────────────

// The ruling asks that a task whose diff touched `src/mcp/**` or `src/bin/**` not be
// marked DONE without evidence of `bash install-ai-os.sh` plus a server restart, because
// "the three CI-only failures this sprint were all a laptop mirror a release behind".
//
// The evidence is taken from STATE, not from prose. A LOG line saying `bash
// install-ai-os.sh` is evidence that the words were typed; a mirror that matches src/ is
// evidence that the install happened. The two questions the gate actually asks are
// therefore direct ones, and neither needs a git diff:
//
//   1. Does the mirror still differ from src/ under the gated roots?  → install not run.
//   2. Is any RUNNING server serving a build that is no longer on disk? → not restarted.
//
// Asking (1) this way also removes the need to reconstruct "the task's diff", which is
// not knowable from a task id: a task's changes may be uncommitted, on a branch, or
// already merged. If the operator touched nothing under those roots, src/ and the mirror
// agree and the gate is silent — which is the same answer a perfect diff would give.

// resolves `*`). Comparing them would make the gate fire on every task forever, and a gate
