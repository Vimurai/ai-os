// markdown-exec.mjs — which lines of a markdown file are CODE and which are PROSE
// (E-224, D-058 §3).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS:
//   `run_review` graded every added line the same way, so the Architect's own D-057 prose
//   in `.ai/DECISIONS.md` tripped a P0 PATH_TRAVERSAL — it QUOTES `join(req.path, "../")`
//   as the example of what must stay blocking. A review gate that blocks the document
//   describing the gate is the same over-block E-222 set out to remove, one layer up.
//
//   The obvious fix — skip `.md` — is the dangerous one, and it is why this file exists
//   rather than a one-line filter. Skill files carry `!`-prefixed lines that the harness
//   AUTO-EXECUTES at session start, and `src/shared/skills/ai-preflight/SKILL.md:18` is
//   exactly such a line resolving a helper cwd-relative (T-LOCATOR-001, still open at the
//   time of writing). Skipping markdown would blind the gate to the one class of markdown
//   that genuinely runs.
//
//   So: `!`-lines and fences tagged with an executable language are CODE; everything else
//   in a markdown file is DOCUMENTATION. PATH_TRAVERSAL applies to code lines only.
//   HARDCODED_SECRET keeps applying everywhere — a leaked credential in prose is still a
//   leaked credential.

/** Files whose `!`-lines the harness auto-executes. */
// Claude Code auto-executes `!`-lines in slash-command markdown too
// (`.claude/commands/**.md`), not only in SKILL.md and agent files. Anchored to the
// tool's own directories rather than any path containing `commands/` — an unanchored
// `.*\/commands\/` would also grade `docs/commands/usage.md` as code — and it covers
// the NESTED namespaced form `.claude/commands/<ns>/<cmd>.md`, which `[^/]+\.md` missed,
// i.e. the insurance was incomplete in the one place it was meant to apply. Both the
// CANONICAL trees (`src/claude/commands/…`, `src/agents/…`) and the generated mirrors
// count: the standards rule and the commit gate run over `src/`, so covering only the
// mirror would grade a canonical command file as prose exactly where it is enforced —
// inverting the E-201 lesson that `src/` is canonical and mirrors are derived. No file
// exists in this repo today, so nothing is live — but the day one is added, the
// whole E-224/E-225 apparatus would be blind to it, which is the cheapest kind of
// gap to close before it matters.
