/**
 * skill-promoter.mjs — E-94 (ecc-integrations.md §Components 2 & §Security)
 *
 * Promotes a PROPOSED instinct skill (staged inert by instinct-stager, E-93)
 * to an ACTIVE Gemini skill — but ONLY behind the Human-in-the-Loop
 * approval-mcp gate. The caller obtains a decision from
 * `approval-mcp::request_approval` and passes it here; promotion proceeds only
 * when `decision.status === "APPROVED"`. Every other state (REJECTED, NON_TTY,
 * missing) is fail-closed: nothing is activated.
 *
 * Defence in depth on the skill-injection surface (blueprint §Security):
 *   1. approval gate     — no APPROVED decision ⇒ no promotion.
 *   2. content re-scan   — re-checks the body for secrets / destructive shell
 *                          via instinct-stager's scanDangerousContent, even
 *                          though staging already filtered it.
 *   3. no-clobber        — refuses to overwrite an existing ACTIVE skill.
 *   4. safe-slug         — refuses path-unsafe directory names.
 *
 * Pure module — no stdout writes (MCP stdout-purity); returns result objects.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   listProposedSkills(proposedDir)        -> [{ slug, path }]
 *   activateContent(content)               -> string (frontmatter flipped active)
 *   promoteSkill(slug, opts)               -> { promoted, ... }
