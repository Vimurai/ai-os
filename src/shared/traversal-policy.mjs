// traversal-policy.mjs — how `run_review` grades a `../` in a diff (E-222, D-057 §2).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS:
//   The check was one flat regex — any added line containing `../`, `/etc/` or `/root/`
//   was a P0 that BLOCKED the commit. That is right for a path assembled from runtime
//   input and wrong for the ordinary idiom of resolving a file relative to the script
//   that needs it. It blocked E-220's own fix for a real vulnerability, on a line
//   (`"${_sd}/../shared/sync-manifest.mjs"`) whose shape already existed at four other
//   sites in the same file — they simply were not in that diff.
//
//   A gate that fires on correct code teaches people to route around it, which costs more
//   than the check earns. So the severity now depends on what the `../` is ANCHORED to:
//
//     /etc/ or /root/                          → P0, unchanged
//     `../` anchored to a script-relative base → P1 advisory (still reported)
//     `../` anywhere else                      → P0, unchanged
//
//   Advisory, not silent: a P1 still appears in the report, so a reviewer sees every
//   traversal. Only the BLOCKING changes.
//
// Rollback: AI_OS_REVIEW_STRICT_TRAVERSAL=1 restores the flat regex (every `../` is P0).
