#     "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/src/<helper>"
# which names the USER's repository, not the AI-OS install. A project containing
# `src/mcp/safe-exec-mcp/index.js` therefore had THAT file executed by node from inside a
# PreToolUse hook, with its stdout trusted to decide whether a write is allowed: cloning a
# repo was enough to run its code AND disable the gate meant to stop it.
#
# The canary cases below are the point of this suite. They plant an executable marker in a
# decoy repo and assert it never runs. A grep for the old idiom would pass against a
# resolver that still consults the visited repo by another route, so the assertions are on
# EXECUTION, not on source text.
