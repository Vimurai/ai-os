# provider_workspace_test.sh — E-244 (D-066 §4): workspaces follow the role binding.
#
# `ai sync` used to provision every vendor workspace on every project, unconditionally,
# regardless of what .ai/roles.json said. v4 (D-069) ships one built-in provider, `claude`;
# a provider declared in .ai/providers.json with a `workspace_dir` is still classified, and
# its workspace is stale when no role is bound to it. The fixtures below use a neutral
# declared provider, `acme` (workspace .acme/), for that half.
#
# THE DANGEROUS HALF IS THE PRUNE, and it is weighted accordingly below. "Delete the
# directory of a provider nobody uses" is one careless `rm -rf` away from deleting a
# user's own skill, so the prune reuses E-220's evidence rules with an EMPTY source set:
# sync wrote it, nobody edited it, nothing upstream provides it. Everything else is
# reported and kept, and the directory survives if anything is left in it.
#
# .claude/ IS NEVER STALE even when roles.json does not name claude — the git hooks,
# settings.json and the SessionStart role stamp live there. A corrupt roles.json must not
# take the hook wiring with it.
